learning to code a webapp with Fastapi backend and React frontend (not next.js actually)

following the tutorial from Tech With Tim https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1P0Uqk50Ps  

source code is available on his github repo https://github.com/techwithtim/Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-AI/tree/main  

=> I still need to follow the API routers and AI story generation parts
